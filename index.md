Warcbase is an open-source platform for managing web archives built on Hadoop and HBase. The platform provides a flexible data model for storing and managing raw content as well as metadata and extracted knowledge. Tight integration with Hadoop provides powerful tools for analytics and data processing via Spark.

You can [download Warcbase here](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase). The easiest way would be to follow our [Getting Started tutorial](http://lintool.github.io/warcbase-docs/Getting-Started/).

Use Warcbase to [unleash your web archives](http://archivesunleashed.ca/)! These documents will show you how...

Note: many of these tutorials currently assume a working knowledge of a Unix command line environment. For a conceptual and practical introduction, please see Ian Milligan and James Baker's "Introduction to the Bash Command Line" at the [*Programming Historian*](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-bash).

If you've just arrived, you're probably interested in using [**Spark to analyze your web archive collections**](http://lintool.github.io/warcbase-docs/Analyzing-Web-Archives-with-Spark/): gathering collection statistics, textual analysis, network analysis, etc.

If you want to explore web archives using other means, we have walkthroughs to use the SHINE front end on Solr indexes generated using Warcbase. See [this SHINE walkthrough](http://lintool.github.io/warcbase-docs/Shine:-Installing-Shine-Frontend-on-OS-X/) and this [building Lucene indexes](http://lintool.github.io/warcbase-docs/Building-Lucene-Indexes-Using-Hadoop/) walkthrough.
