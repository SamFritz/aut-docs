One popular digital humanities tool is [Gephi](http://gephi.github.io/). You can quickly use it to convert output into a dynamic, date-ordered visualization to see how link structures have changed over time.

<h3>Step One: Convert Site Link Structure into GDF Format</h3>

Use the included `pig2gdf.py` program. Usage is as follows:

```
pig2gdf.py usage:
$ ./pig2gdf.py <file> > <OUTPUT>
```

Example usage:
```
./pig2gdf.py part-m-00000 > political-links.csv
```

<h3>Step Two: Import into Gephi</h3>

You now want to take it into Gephi. Start Gephi (<a href="http://ianmilligan.ca/2014/07/15/getting-gephi-running-on-os-x-mavericks/">if you have trouble running it, this tutorial might help</a>). Open the GDF file that you just generated. Click OK.

Now visit the 'Data Laboratory' panel and do the following. Select the 'edges' table so it looks like this.

Click on the 'Merge Columns' button and do this:

Make sure to parse dates as <strong>yyyymm</strong>.

The final step is to click on 'nodes' in the upper left, click 'copy data to other column,' select 'id,' and copy to 'label.'

<h3>Step Three: Explore your Data</h3>

You'll now notice that you have the option to enable a dynamic timeslider at the bottom of your Gephi window. 

While a full tutorial in Gephi visualization is outside the scope of this document, you may want to use the following to expand the link nodes. Select the 'overview' tab to see a preview of the node structure. Under layout, use the 'Force Atlas' visualization to move the nodes.
