## Java

The Archives Unleashed Toolkit requires Java 8.

For macOS: You can find information on Java [here](https://java.com/en/download/help/mac_install.xml). We recommend [OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/). The easiest way is to install with [homebrew](https://brew.sh) and then:

```bash
brew cask install adoptopenjdk/openjdk/adoptopenjdk8
```

If you run into difficulties with homebrew, installation instructions can be found [here](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

On Debian based system you can install Java using `apt`:

```bash
apt install openjdk-8-jdk
```

Before `spark-shell` can launch, `JAVA_HOME` must be set. If you receive an error that `JAVA_HOME` is not set, you need to point it to where Java is installed. On Linux, this might be `export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64` or on macOS it might be `export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_74.jdk/Contents/Home`.

## Python

If you would like to use the Archives Unleashed Toolkit with PySpark and Jupyter Notebooks, you'll need to have a modern version of Python installed. We recommend using the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution). This _should_ install Jupyter Notebook, as well as the PySpark bindings. If it doesn't, you can install either with `conda install` or `pip install`.

## Apache Spark

Download and unzip [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org) to a location of your choice.

```bash
curl -L "https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-2.4.5/spark-2.4.5-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz" > spark-2.4.5-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
tar -xvf spark-2.4.5-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
```
