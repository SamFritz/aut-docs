# About the Archives Unleashed Toolkit

The Archives Unleashed Toolkit, or AUT, applies modern big data analytics infrastructure to the scholarly analysis of web archives. Built on Hadoop, it provides powerful tools for analytics and data processing via Apache [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/).


AUT is built against CDH 5.4.1:
+ Hadoop version: 2.6.0-cdh5.4.1
+ Spark version: 1.3.0-cdh5.4.1

The Hadoop ecosystem is evolving rapidly, so there may be incompatibilities with other versions.
