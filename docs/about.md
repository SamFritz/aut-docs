# About the Archives Unleashed Toolkit

The Archives Unleashed Toolkit, or AUT, applies modern big data analytics infrastructure to the scholarly analysis of web archives. Built on Hadoop, it provides powerful tools for analytics and data processing via Apache [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/). AUT grew out of the Warcbase project. You can read about (and cite!) Warcbase in a [recent ACM Journal of Computing and Cultural Heritage article](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3129537.3097570).

AUT is built against CDH 5.4.1:
+ Hadoop version: 2.6.0-cdh5.4.1
+ Spark version: 1.3.0-cdh5.4.1

The Hadoop ecosystem is evolving rapidly, so there may be incompatibilities with other versions.

You are currently in our documentation.
