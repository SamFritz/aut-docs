# Installing Warcbase

Getting warcbase started is pretty easy! You have two dependencies: you need to have `git` installed, and you need to have Maven installed. On OS X, we recommend [installing homebrew](http://brew.sh/). 

Note: many of these tutorials currently assume a working knowledge of a Unix command line environment. For a conceptual and practical introduction, please see Ian Milligan and James Baker's "Introduction to the Bash Command Line" at the [*Programming Historian*](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-bash).

Once you get to the Spark Notebook stage, you can work in your web browser.

## Step One: Installing Dependencies

There are two main dependencies to install, [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/). 

### OS X

In OS X, we recommend just using [homebrew](http://brew.sh/). This is a package manager that can simplify everything.

In your terminal, type:

```
brew install git
brew install maven
```

### Windows

Using [Git Bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/), you will need to install git. It is [a straightforward installation](https://git-scm.com/). For Maven, [download a copy here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) (we recommend the binary zip archive for Windows users). Then following the instructions for "Windows Tips" [here](https://maven.apache.org/install.html). 

### Linux

In Linux, you can install git using:

```
apt-get install git
```

For Maven, [download it from here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). We have tested using the tar archive. All you should need to do is add it to your path, as in:

```
export PATH=/opt/apache-maven-3.3.9/bin:$PATH
```

## Step Two: Installing Warcbase

Then, in the directory where you want to install warcbase, run the following terminal commands.

First, clone the repo:

```
$ git clone http://github.com/lintool/warcbase.git
```

Second, you can now build Warcbase by typing:

```
$ mvn clean package appassembler:assemble
```

For the impatient, to skip tests:

```
$ mvn clean package appassembler:assemble -DskipTests
```

## Step Three: Testing with Spark Shell

Now to test, load up the Spark shell. The command looks like:

```
spark-shell --jars target/warcbase-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-fatjar.jar
```

You may have to provide full paths. For example, `/users/spark-1.5.1/bin/spark-shell --jars target/warcbase-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-fatjar.jar`.

This command accepts flags. As you get more advanced, you might want to pass it more memory, using the `--driver-memory` flag. For example, this following command will let your Spark Shell use up to 8GB of memory.

```
users/spark-1.5.1/bin/spark-shell --driver-memory 8G --jars --jars target/warcbase-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-fatjar.jar
```

Now run the following sample script to see if it works. To enter code blocks you will need to type `:paste` first. Paste the command, and then press `Ctrl+D`.

```scala
import org.warcbase.spark.matchbox._
import org.warcbase.spark.rdd.RecordRDD._

val r = RecordLoader.loadArchives("src/test/resources/arc/example.arc.gz", sc)
  .keepValidPages()
  .map(r => ExtractDomain(r.getUrl))
  .countItems()
  .take(10)
```

If you see results, you're up and running!

Above, you can see that if you find other scripts here, you could just change the line with `RecordLoader` to point it at your data, and the lines after `.keepValidPages()` to the analyses you want to run!

## Step Four: Setting up Spark Notebook

![Spark notebook showing pie chart output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ianmilligan1/WAHR/master/images/Spark-Notebook.png)

You might find the Spark Shell ungainly when prototyping. Luckily, Spark Notebook can come and help you.

Spark Notebook is an interactive web-based editor that can run Scala and Spark. 

To use Spark Notebook with Warcbase, download the [notebook](http://spark-notebook.io/) with the following options Scala 2.10, Spark 1.3.0, and Hadoop 2.6.0-cdh5.4.2. 

Unzip the downloaded zip file, `cd` into the directory in your terminal, and run the following command:

```
./bin/spark-notebook`
```

The terminal should read `Listening for HTTP on /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:9000`

Then navigate to `http://localhost:9000/` in your browser.

To make a new notebook, click the '+' button on the top right-hand corner.

The **first command** needs to load the warcbase jar. Make sure to change the path to the location of your own warcbase installation:

```scala
:cp /Users/ianmilligan1/dropbox/warcbase/target/warcbase-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-fatjar.jar
```

You are now ready to run your first script. Try the following, making sure to provide a full path in lieu of `src/test/resources/arc/example.arc.gz`. 

```scala
import org.warcbase.spark.matchbox._ 
import org.warcbase.spark.rdd.RecordRDD._ 

val r = 
RecordLoader.loadArchives("/USER/warcbase/src/test/resources/arc/example.arc.gz", sc) 
.keepValidPages() 
.map(r => ExtractDomain(r.getUrl)) 
.countItems() 
.take(10) 
```

If you want to see more than ten results, change the variable in the last line. 

You are now ready to explore warcbase. 

## Step Five: Loading Sample WARCs

A very useful next step is trying the above scripts with some real WARC files. You can find these in our [warcbase-resources](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase-resources) repository.

In your command line, you can clone it using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lintool/warcbase-resources.git
```

Try it yourself! Load up Spark Shell, and run the first command above but point it at `ARCHIVEIT-227-UOFTORONTO-CANPOLPINT-20060622205612-00009-crawling025.archive.org.arc.gz` located in the `warcbase-resources/Sample-Data directory`.

Now try the Spark Shell.

## Step Six: Profit

Time to explore the other scripts in this documentation. Enjoy! [If you want to install it on a Cloud Computer, these documents will help you](http://lintool.github.io/warcbase-docs/Spark-Installing-Spark-Notebook-on-a-Cloud-Computer/).
