# Getting Started with Warcbase

Getting warcbase started is pretty easy! You have two dependencies: you need to have `git` installed, and you need to have Maven installed. On OS X, we recommend [installing homebrew](http://brew.sh/). 

Note: many of these tutorials currently assume a working knowledge of a Unix command line environment. For a conceptual and practical introduction, please see Ian Milligan and James Baker's "Introduction to the Bash Command Line" at the [*Programming Historian*](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-bash).

Once you get to the Spark Notebook stage, you can work in your web browser.

Install dependencies:

```
brew install git
brew install maven
```

Then, in the directory where you want to install warcbase, run the following terminal commands.

First, clone the repo:

```
$ git clone http://github.com/lintool/warcbase.git
```

Second, you can now build Warcbase:

```
$ mvn clean package appassembler:assemble
```

For the impatient, to skip tests:

```
$ mvn clean package appassembler:assemble -DskipTests
```

Finally, to create Eclipse project files (optional):

```
$ mvn eclipse:clean
$ mvn eclipse:eclipse
```

You can then import the project into Eclipse.

What's next? We recommend [connecting your installation to a Spark Notebook](./Spark:-Installing-Spark-Notebook-on-a-Cloud-Computer/). Read on!
