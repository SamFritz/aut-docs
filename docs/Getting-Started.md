- Assistance with setting up Spark is in the [Getting Started Section of the Home Page](./index.html).

- Scripts are currently written in Scala with Python support coming soon. For a quick introduction to the language, [Programming in Scala](http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/index.html) by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon, and Bill Venners is a good introduction.

- [Collection Level Analytics](./Spark-Collection-Analytics/): Use Spark Notebook to generate an interactive visualization of what's in your collections.
