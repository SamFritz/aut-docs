The Archives Unleashed Toolkit is an open-source platform for managing web archives built on [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/). The platform provides a flexible data model for storing and managing raw content as well as metadata and extracted knowledge. Tight integration with Hadoop provides powerful tools for analytics and data processing via [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/). For more information on the project and the team behind it, visit our [about page](./about/).
