Welcome to the warcbase wiki! Here, you'll find various pig scripts and instructions to unlock your rich web archive collections.

**These pages are under active development, as of June 2015.**

If you are using warcbase, we would love to hear from you. [Please let us know](mailto:i2millig@uwaterloo.ca).

***

Note: many of these tutorials currently assume a working knowledge of a Unix command line environment. For a conceptual and practical introduction, please see Ian Milligan and James Baker's "Introduction to the Bash Command Line" at the *Programming Historian*, <http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-bash>.

<h2>Getting Started?</h2>

This is still actively under development, with several features in the pipeline (notably topic modelling and text visualization support).

To get started, may we suggest the following tutorials:
* [Building and Running Warcbase under OS X](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Building-and-Running-Warcbase-Under-OS-X)
* [Ingesting Content](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Getting-Started:-Ingesting-Content)
* [Running Pig Scripts](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Pig:-Running-Pig-Scripts)
* [Gathering Basic Crawl Statistics](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Pig:-Gathering-and-Visualizing-Basic-Crawl-Statistics)

The first tutorial teaches you how to install Warcbase, the second how to run the basic pig scripts, and the latter one generates basic crawl statistics. These are essential if you want to make sense of the collection that you are working with.

<h2>Want an Overall Look at Your Collections?</h2>

We are currently working on integration with the Shine front-end, which lets you see trends and explore a collection with faceted search. We currently have one tutorial:
* [Installing the Shine frontend on OS X](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Shine:-Installing-Shine-Frontend-on-OS-X)

<h2>Want a Link Visualization?</h2>

If you want to work with links, we have a few tutorials for you!
* [Analysis of Site Link Structure](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Pig:-Analysis-of-Site-Link-Structure): This is a critical tutorial that generates the link graph.
* [Using Gephi to Create a Dynamic Link Visualization](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Gephi:-Converting-Site-Link-Structure-into-Dynamic-Visualization)
* [Analysis of Specific Links](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Pig:-Analysis-of-Links-to-Social-Media)

<h2>Want to Work With Text?</h2>

If you want to work with text, you've found the right suite.
* [Building Lucene Indexes Using Hadoop](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Building-Lucene-Indexes-Using-Hadoop)
* [Extracting Domain-Level Plain Text](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Pig:-Extracting-Domain-Level-Plain-Text)
* [Named Entity Recognition on a Cluster](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Pig:-Named-Entity-Recognition-(on-a-cluster))
