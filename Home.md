Welcome to the warcbase wiki! Here, you'll find instructions to unlock your web collections. These pages continue to be under active development as of November 2015.

If you are using warcbase, we would love to hear from you. [Please let us know](mailto:i2millig@uwaterloo.ca).

***

Note: many of these tutorials currently assume a working knowledge of a Unix command line environment. For a conceptual and practical introduction, please see Ian Milligan and James Baker's "Introduction to the Bash Command Line" at the *Programming Historian*, <http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-bash>.

<h2>Getting Started?</h2>

#### To use Spark to analyze your collections, please [visit this landing page](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Analyzing-Web-Archives-with-Spark). 

Here you will find scripts for **textual analysis**, **network analysis**, and **overall collection statistics**. 

To use Pig to analyze your collections, please visit the scripts that you can find in the right hand column under "Pig." We are currently moving from Pig to Spark and development will be accordingly focused on Spark.

If you want to explore other front ends, we have walkthroughs to use the SHINE front end on solr indexes generated using warcbase. See [this SHINE walkthrough](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Shine:-Installing-Shine-Frontend-on-OS-X) and this [building Lucene indexes](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Building-Lucene-Indexes-Using-Hadoop) walkthrough.
