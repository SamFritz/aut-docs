Welcome to the warcbase wiki! Here, you'll find instructions to unlock your web collections. These pages continue to be under active development as of November 2015.

If you are using warcbase, we would love to hear from you. [Please let us know](mailto:i2millig@uwaterloo.ca).

***

Note: many of these tutorials currently assume a working knowledge of a Unix command line environment. For a conceptual and practical introduction, please see Ian Milligan and James Baker's "Introduction to the Bash Command Line" at the *Programming Historian*, <http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-bash>.

<h2>Getting Started?</h2>

This is still actively under development, with several features in the pipeline (notably topic modelling and text visualization support).

To get started, may we suggest the following tutorials:
* [Building and Running Warcbase under OS X](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Building-and-Running-Warcbase-Under-OS-X)
* [Building and Running Spark under OS X](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Installing-and-Running-Spark-under-OS-X)
* [Ingesting Content](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Getting-Started:-Ingesting-Content)
* [Running Pig Scripts](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Pig:-Running-Pig-Scripts)
* [Gathering Basic Crawl Statistics](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Pig:-Gathering-and-Visualizing-Basic-Crawl-Statistics)

<h2>Want an Overall Look at Your Collections?</h2>

We are currently working on integration with the Shine front-end, which lets you see trends and explore a collection with faceted search. We currently have one tutorial:
* [Installing the Shine frontend on OS X](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Shine:-Installing-Shine-Frontend-on-OS-X)

<h2>Want a Link Visualization?</h2>

If you want to work with links, we have a few tutorials for you!
* [Analysis of Site Link Structure](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Pig:-Analysis-of-Site-Link-Structure): This is a critical tutorial that generates the link graph.
* [Using Gephi to Create a Dynamic Link Visualization](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Gephi:-Converting-Site-Link-Structure-into-Dynamic-Visualization)
* [Analysis of Specific Links](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Pig:-Analysis-of-Links-to-Social-Media)

<h2>Want to Work With Text?</h2>

If you want to work with text, you've found the right suite.
* [Building Lucene Indexes Using Hadoop](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Building-Lucene-Indexes-Using-Hadoop)
* [Extracting Domain-Level Plain Text](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Pig:-Extracting-Domain-Level-Plain-Text)
* [Named Entity Recognition on a Cluster](https://github.com/lintool/warcbase/wiki/Pig:-Named-Entity-Recognition-(on-a-cluster))
